# Web Application Security

**[Web App Security Fundamentals](fundamentals)** The core concepts behind the gritty details of how web applications work and common ways that web applications are compromised.

## Why?

Web applications are incredibly popular, but browser vendors have historically made a lot of poor security decisions. The situation is getting better, but the web remains a largely hostile platform to build applications for.

This pushes a lot of responsibility onto application developers. We must turn on options that should really be on by default, add application level mitigations for vulnerabilities that are inherent to the platform, and keep up with the increasing number of controls being made available to fix historical mistakes.

## Tasks

* Read the fundamentals
* Work through the checklist for your platform
* Read the best practices
* Use the tool section as a resource
