# Security Baseline
Making a bullet-proof app is probably not feasible, and depending on what your app does, certain security measures might be even be overkill.

To make covering the basics easy, here's a set of guidelines that likely apply to your project:

* No secrets in the code
* Use a dependency checker
* Validate user inputs
* No production data in non-prod environments
* Proper access controls
* Enforce HTTPS universally
* Enable logging
