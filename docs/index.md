## Why security matters

(security matters because the consequences are severe)

## A security mindset

The actual practice of producing more secure systems rests almost entirely on adopting a security mindset. You don't need specialized knowledge in how exploitations work or to attend hacking competitions. Mostly, you just need a daily practice of asking yourself the right questions, and a commitment to follow the best practices for the technology stack you are working with.

What are the right questions? The questions you should be asking are the questions that a paranoid version of yourself would be asking. Paranoia, in programming and devops, is healthy.

Humans trust one another--it is the only way that we survive. Trust is what allowed homo sapiens to flourish, to form tribes, to work in groups. Without trust, we would have no intimacy, no real human connection. Trust is essential to what it means to be human.

Computers also rely on trust. When you turn on a computer and open a web page, you are placing trust in thousands people. You are trusting the company that produced the chips, the programmers who wrote and compiled the code, every network operator between you and the DNS server, every certificate authority on earth, the handful of people who understand how to properly audit the cryptography on which we rely, and on and on.

All this trust is invisible to you, all these social relationships are invisible, appearing as a mundane and natural action. What is more simple than opening a web page?

Your job, as a technologist, is pull back the veil that makes these social relationships invisible. You must always be thinking about exactly who and what you are trusting. Most importantly, you must strive to find ways to reduce this trust.

Trust is always a liability: when you trust someone, it means they can harm you. For human relationships, this is a necessary compromise. In exchange for being able to get hurt, we are able to be humans.

But for computers, trust is the enemy. Every security flaw, single security breach, every company taken down, every career ruined, every activist thrown in jail or killed because of government surveillance, are all caused by placing trust in a technological system or technologist.

The way you write secure software and practice secure practices is to learn to see where you are placing trust and work to mitigate any harm that could be caused by this.

If you are not paranoid, you are doing it wrong. Paranoia is exactly the required mindset. Everything is out to get you, or, more precisely, the software you write.

However, there are rapidly diminishing returns from time spent being paranoid. Most likely, no one is actually out to get you. You could spend a hundred years trying to make an application perfectly secure and you will still never achieve absolute security. All our technology is flawed, but we can adopt reasonable best practices for ongoing maintenance of technical systems that will allow us to prevent the vast majority of exploitable flaws.
