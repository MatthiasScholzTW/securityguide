title: Infrastructure Security Tools

This is an unsorted grab bag of various security tools.

## Sysdig

<https://www.sysdig.org/>

Sysdig captures system calls and events from the Linux kernel. You can save, filter, and analyze the data with our CLI or our desktop app. Think of sysdig as strace + tcpdump + htop + iftop + lsof + wireshark for your entire system.

## CyberChef

<https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef>

Swiss Army Knife for encoded information: does conversions, decryption, hashing, everything. Very handy! From UK's spooks!

## Snoopy Logger

<https://github.com/a2o/snoopy>

Logs all shell commands to syslog.

Not useful for forensics, because it can be bypassed, but useful to audit if something goes wrong in a non-attack situation.

## VULNREPORT

<http://vulnreport.io>

Automation and management platform for penetration tests and security audits.
