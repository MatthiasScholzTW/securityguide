title: Dependency Checker
---

Using components with known vulnerabilities is a [widespread and serious problem][owasp-a9] in application development. It can lead to easy, scannable vulnerabilities in your app. Recommended tools for a variety of languages are provided elsewhere in this project:

* [Ruby]
* [Java]
* [JavaScript]
* [Python]

Are you using a tool that isn't in this repo? Are you developing with a language or framework not currently supported? Create an issue or submit a PR so we can get it added as quickly as possible.
